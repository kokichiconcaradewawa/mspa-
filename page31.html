  <div class="text"> 
you felt something, something you had never felt before, it is a strange feeling that made your mind forget all those thoughts and bad experiences, it is something beautiful.

is it love? you wonder, but then you realize it is something more than just love, it was a feeling of being safe, of someone truly caring about you and you still didn’t understand why

you had done horrible things in the past, but she made those things look like just mistakes
    
    She really loves you
    She really cares about you 
    
    You really love her  </div>
