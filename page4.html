    YOu like playing bass, well, unfortunately you liked playing bass because you sold it for...personal...uses but you still miss your blue and pretty bass
    you liked playing songs from the band MSI (mindless self indulgence) wich is a kinda problematic band but you liked it, you tried learning a song called PROM but it wwas really hard and there were no tutorials or tabs, you just watched a girl cosplaying Lynz while platuong the song and trying to see if the notes were the same notes, you can remember the video wich is <a href ="https://youtu.be/YLAYfzFyXPQ?si=-mMy_2r4Z_hJG1HB"> this one </a>
<br>

this is not considered a hobbie or an interest but its something really dangerous to you ;(
